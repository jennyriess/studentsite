            How painful the hangover was today<br>
            In front of the toilet, hands and knees<br>
            Trying to breathe in between the dry heaves<br>
            My baby made me some coffee<br>
            Afraid that if I drink some it's probably coming right back out me<br>
            Couple of Advil, relax and chill<br>
            At a standstill with how bad I feel<br>
            I think I need to smell fresh hair<br>
            So I stepped out the back door and fell down the stairs<br>
            The sunlight hit me dead in the eye<br>
            Like it's mad I gave half the day to last night<br>
            My bad sight made me trip on my ass right into<br>
            That patch of grass like that's life<br>
            All of a sudden, I realize something<br>
            The weather is amazing, even the birds are bumpin'<br>
            Stood up and took a look and a breath<br>
            And there's that bike that I forgot that I possessed<br>
            Never really seen exercise as friendly<br>
            But I thing something's telling me to ride that ten speed<br>
            The brakes are broken, it's alright<br>
            The tires got air and the chain seems tight<br>
            Hopped on and felt the summertime,<br>
            It reminds me of one of them Musab lines like<br>
            Sunshine, sunshine, it's fine<br>
            I feel it in my skin, warming up my mind,<br>
            Sometimes you gotta give in to win,<br>
            I love the days when it shines, whoa let it <a href="index.html" class="twister">shine</a></p>
